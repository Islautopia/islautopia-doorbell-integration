"""The doorbell notifies Home Assistant over a webhook (API_CONTRACT.md §4).

Replaces MQTT, and the reason is not technical but a product one: MQTT required the user to have a
broker installed, and this integration has to work on a freshly installed Home Assistant, the same
way the apps do. A prerequisite half the audience does not meet is not an integration: it is a
manual.

What arrives is **the §3.6.1 envelope without changing a comma**, the same one the doorbell already
builds for the relay. A format of our own for Home Assistant would be a fifth dialect to maintain.

## ⚠️ WHY THIS HANDLER RETURNS A BODY, AND IT IS NOT A COURTESY

Measured 2026-08-24 against a real Home Assistant: **it answers `200` to a webhook that does NOT
exist**, with an empty body. That is deliberate on its part - so nobody can enumerate an
installation's webhooks by probing them.

Consequence: by status code alone the doorbell **cannot tell** "delivered" from "Home Assistant
forgot about me". A doorbell whose integration was removed would keep firing into the void forever
with its failure counter at zero - both extremes saying everything is fine and nothing happening,
which is the failure family this project keeps hunting.

**The body's marker is the only thing that breaks that tie.** And a Home Assistant handler that
returns `None` **also** produces an empty 200, so returning it is a REQUIREMENT: forgetting the
body makes the doorbell pronounce a perfectly alive integration dead.
