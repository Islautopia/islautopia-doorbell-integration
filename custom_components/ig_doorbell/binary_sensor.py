"""Presence and package, plus two diagnostic ones.

## ⚠️ WHY THESE TWO TURN THEMSELVES OFF AND THE OTHER DOES NOT

MQTT used to publish `videoportero/persona` with ON and OFF: the doorbell said when someone
arrived **and when the area was clear again**. The webhook carries EVENTS (§3.6.1), which are
edges, and §1.16 has a `visitor` - "someone is there" - and **no "nobody is there any more"**.

So a visitor sensor fed by events would stay on forever. It turns itself off after a while, which
is what any Home Assistant motion sensor does and what the user already expects of one.

**The package does NOT carry a timeout, and that asymmetry is deliberate**: there §1.16 DOES have
the full pair (`package` and `package_gone`), so turning it off by time would be inventing an
ending the doorbell already knows how to say - and worse, it would turn off a package that is
still on the doormat. A package is a still object: it stays for hours.
