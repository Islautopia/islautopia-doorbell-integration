"""ONE event entity that carries EVERYTHING the doorbell can report (§1.16).

## Why a single one, not one per event

Because the catalog grows. §1.16 has 24 entries today and has already grown three times this
month, and one entity per event would mean **a new doorbell feature is invisible until someone
updates this integration**. With a single entity and an open list of types, an event this code
does not know about still arrives and can be automated the same day.

It is also what Home Assistant expects of something momentary: a ring has no state, it has an
instant. Modelling it as a `binary_sensor` that turns on and off forces you to invent how long it
lasts - and whoever looks half a second late sees nothing.

## What it does NOT do

It does not filter. The only event dropped here is `hass_action`, and it is not an event: it is a
command (§4), which should not show up in the bell icon nor here - it would be one entry per
light bulb.
