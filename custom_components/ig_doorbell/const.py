# --- Webhook (API_CONTRACT.md §4) -----------------------------------------------------------
# ⚠️ THE MARKER OUR HANDLER RETURNS, and it is not decorative: Home Assistant answers `200` to a
# webhook that does NOT exist (measured 2026-08-24 against a real HA, with an empty body), on
# purpose, so nobody can enumerate an installation's webhooks by probing them. So by status code
# alone the doorbell cannot tell "delivered" from "HA forgot about me", and one whose integration
# was removed would keep firing into the void forever with its failure counter at zero. The marker
# is the only thing that breaks that tie. See webhook.py.

# How often the doorbell is asked for its state. Replaces MQTT's LWT: if `get_states` fails, the
# entities go unavailable, and that comes for free instead of needing a last-will message someone
# has to configure.
#
# 30 s and not 5: almost everything that changes fast arrives **pushed** by the webhook, so polling
# only covers what changes without notice (the mode from the doorbell's own dashboard, the viewer
# count, a street panel showing up). Polling more often would punish the doorbell -
# `esp_http_server` serves one request at a time - to refresh things that almost never move.
POLL_INTERVAL = 30

# --- Home Assistant entities the doorbell may act on (§4) --------------------------------------
# ⚠️ 5 (Inaki, 2026-09-25: "up to 5"), and it is not a memory limit: this list is the WHITELIST of
# what the doorbell can move in the house - the door and the `hass` steps may only point at one of
# these. A short whitelist is reviewed at a glance. Up to 0.7.5 there were 24. The doorbell refuses
# with `400 too_many_entities` instead of trimming.

# --- The doorbell's mode (§1.2, field `m`) -----------------------------------------------------
# ⚠️ 2 used to be called "Night" and the contract named it both ways, which led every client to
# pick one. Unified to **"Do not disturb"**, which describes what it does instead of when it is
# supposed to be used. The numeric value does NOT change: it stays 2, so there is nothing to
# migrate.
#
# ⚠️ The values are translation KEYS (2026-09-25), not text: Home Assistant translates a `select`'s
# state through `translation_key`, so what the owner reads comes out in their own language and what
# an automation stores stays stable. Up to 0.6.x the state was the Spanish text itself ("Ausente").

    throws you off" - looking for where to configure its entities, he did not recognize the entry
    because it was named exactly like its device_id. Same format the firmware itself synthesizes
    for its mDNS instance when nobody has named the doorbell (API_CONTRACT.md, mDNS/Zeroconf,
    "IG Doorbell <device_id>"), so the generic name is the same across every client.
    """
    return f"IG Doorbell {device_id}"

# --- Zeroconf (API_CONTRACT.md §0-bis) ------------------------------------------------------
# Only used for the OPTIONAL pairing-discovery step in config_flow.py (async_step_zeroconf) -
# HA Core matches this against manifest.json's own "zeroconf": ["_igdoorbell._tcp.local."]
# declaration (the actual source of truth for that, not a Python constant) and routes matching
# announcements there. Match discovered instances by the `device_id` TXT record, NEVER by the
# mDNS instance name - the instance name tracks the doorbell's user-editable `device_name` and
# can change at any time (confirmed against the firmware).
#
# Deliberately NOT relied on anywhere else (2026-07-10): a previous
# `discovery.py` module used mDNS to resolve a doorbell's current LAN IP on every card session
# start - removed entirely. Two independent reasons: the card never actually used that value to
# connect (always uses the public hostname, see ARCHITECTURE.md §5/§7 "Q7"), and mDNS is
# multicast, which normally does not cross VLAN/subnet boundaries - relying on it would be
# actively wrong (not just unused) for any doorbell provisioned manually by IP because it lives
# on a different VLAN/subnet than the HA host, a real, legitimate setup. Pairing discovery here
# stays fine because it's purely optional/opportunistic - manual IP entry in config_flow.py
# always works as the real fallback, regardless of network segmentation.
#
# --- HTTP -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUEST_TIMEOUT = 8  # seconds - one-shot REST calls to the doorbell, not streams

# --- The doorbell's certificate name (API_CONTRACT.md §0) -------------------------------------
# ⚠️ ONLY the name the doorbell's TLS certificate is issued for. It is used for SNI and certificate
# validation and is NEVER resolved: the socket always goes to the LAN address this integration
# stored (net.py). There is deliberately no relay host here any more (2026-09-25, Phase 0): Home
# Assistant is a LOCAL client and never reaches the doorbell through the VPS, not even as a fallback.
DOORBELL_HOSTNAME_SUFFIX = "doorbell.islautopia.com"

# --- What the doorbell may act on, and how (contract 4) -------------------------------------
# ⚠️ ONLY THINGS THAT TURN ON AND OFF (Inaki, 2026-09-25). The same list lives in the firmware
# (`hass_domain_allowed`, main/hass.c) and each side checks its own half: the doorbell refuses to
# store anything else, and this integration refuses to act on anything else.
#
# Left out on purpose, and it is not an oversight:
# - `button`, `scene`, `script` (accepted up to 0.7.5): they have no opposite state, so the door's
#   automatic close after `dur` seconds and a sequence step with `on: false` would mean nothing -
#   a setting that silently does nothing is the failure this project keeps hunting.
# - `cover`: a blind has positions in between and "open" takes a while; it is not a switch.
#
# In a LOCK, "on" means OPEN (`lock.unlock`) and "off" means CLOSE (`lock.lock`). Everything else
# maps to `turn_on` / `turn_off` of its own domain.
