"""Thin async HTTP client for the doorbell's own API, over the LAN only.

Every function here takes the per-entry session built by net.crear_sesion(), whose resolver maps
the doorbell's certificate name to its stored LAN address and to nothing else (no DNS, no relay —
Phase 0 of the parity plan, 2026-09-25). The URLs carry `<device_id>.doorbell.islautopia.com`
only so that TLS validates against the name the certificate is issued for.

⚠️ The pairing credential NEVER leaves Home Assistant's server side. Nothing in this module builds a
URL that is handed to a browser; recordings reach the browser through recordings_view.py, which
adds the credential server-side.

    disappoints (§1.4-ter). Before `door_m` was carried, the only way to know was to fail once.
