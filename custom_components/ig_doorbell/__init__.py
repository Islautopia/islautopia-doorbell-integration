"""The IG Doorbell integration.

Four runtime responsibilities - see ARCHITECTURE.md §3 for the reasoning behind what this
integration does NOT do:

  1. Receive what the doorbell has to say, over a webhook, and turn it into entities and events -
     webhook.py plus the entity platforms. This replaced MQTT on 2026-08-24.
  2. Ask the doorbell how it is, so those entities have state - coordinator.py.
  3. Server side of the Lovelace card: relays its signalling (signal_proxy.py) and its recordings
     (recordings_view.py) so the pairing credential never reaches a browser, and tells it which
     entities to read (websocket_api.py). LAN only: nothing here talks to the VPS (net.py).
  4. Config flow itself (Zeroconf discovery + manual entry, no YAML) - config_flow.py.

## Why this integration owns the entities now

It did not use to. Every entity a user saw - mode, doorbell, door, presence - was published by the
firmware's own MQTT discovery, and this integration set up no platforms at all. MQTT is gone
(API_CONTRACT.md §4), and the reason is not technical: a broker is a prerequisite half the audience
does not meet, and this has to work on a Home Assistant somebody installed this morning, exactly
the way the apps do.

What unblocked it is smaller than it sounds. `get_states` took a session cookie and nothing else,
and this integration holds a pairing credential and never the administrator's password - which is
precisely what pairing exists to avoid. So it could not read the doorbell's own state to build a
single entity. The firmware fixed that the same day (§1.2); see api.py.

IMPORTANT (found via real-hardware testing 2026-07-09): the device registered here still carries
the identifier the firmware's old MQTT discovery used, alongside our own. There is nothing left to
merge with today - but a Home Assistant that still carries the old MQTT-published entities would
otherwise end up with two disconnected devices for one physical doorbell.

    # Lovelace card's editor uses the native `ha-selector` device picker (filtered to this
    # integration) to let the user pick a doorbell without ever typing/copying a device_id by
    # hand, and that picker only lists devices that actually exist in the registry.
    #
    # ONE identifier: our own. The card editor's device picker looks up exactly this pair in
    # `device.identifiers`, which is why the device is registered here at all.
    #
    # ⚠️ IT USED TO CARRY A SECOND ONE - the identifier the firmware's old MQTT discovery used -
    # so that Home Assistant would MERGE our device with the one the `mqtt` integration created for
    # the same physical doorbell. That was right while both existed, and it is removed now, because
    # it turned out to cost something I had written down as costing nothing.
    #
    # Measured on 2026-08-24, on a real installation: deleting the doorbell's MQTT device took THIS
    # INTEGRATION'S CONFIG ENTRY with it - the two shared a device, so removing the device removed
    # the entry attached to it. The webhook went with it, the doorbell carried on writing to an
    # address nobody was listening at, and the door stopped opening. Nothing said why; the only
    # trace was `async_remove_entry` logging that it could not unconfigure the webhook.
    #
    # And a second half that only got away with it by luck: that same removal path TELLS THE
    # DOORBELL TO STOP WRITING. It failed today because the removed entry's credential was already
    # dead. With a live one it would have succeeded - and the doorbell would have gone quiet
    # because of a deletion the user never aimed at us.
    #
    # The merge bought nothing any more: the firmware stopped speaking MQTT that same morning. An
    # installation upgrading from before will keep its old MQTT entities as a separate, unavailable
    # device, which is honest - they are not ours and nothing feeds them.
